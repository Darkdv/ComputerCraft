Real quick.

This allows one to access the status of a minecraft server. Computercraft can't access the status directly. 
As such, there is a python proxy that translates the data. 

Download the proxy, edit the config.yaml file, and the monitor.py file and then run.

Light.lua is a simple script that queries the proxy, and sends a redstone signal if there is one or more players on the server
